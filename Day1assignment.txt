Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Ans: 

HTTP1.1: 

>> HTTP/1.1 is the first standardized version of HTTP. It was introduced in the year 1997. It was a better upgrade compared to the earlier versions of HTTP 0.9 and HTTP 1.0

>> In the earlier versions of HTTP, a connection was terminated immediately after a request was served with response, but it was no longer required for HTTP1.1 a keep-alive header was introduced which helped in maintaining consequent multiple connections. 

Some of the advantages were 

1. Pipelining - a second request can be sent as soon as the first one is served

2. content negotiation - The client and server could have an exchange to determine the media type. 

3. cache control - Helped to specify caching policies in both requests and responses


HTTP2:

>> HTTP2 was introduced in the year 2015 based on SPDY, the experimental protocol by google. 

>> The key feature of HTTP2 is that it introduced the concept of Server push. This means, a server anticipate the resources required by  the client and publish them before the client makes the request. But the authority to deny the server push is with the client.

>> It introduced the concept of multiplexing in a single TCP connection

>> HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1. HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
